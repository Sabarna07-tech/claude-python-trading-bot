AI Trading Bot with Claude and Python (Official SDK)
This project is a Python implementation of an AI-powered trading bot that connects the Claude Large Language Model (LLM) to a Zerodha trading account. It uses the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) Python SDK to expose trading functions as "tools" that Claude can understand and execute based on natural language commands.

ðŸ”´ DISCLAIMER: This is for educational purposes only. Trading bots carry a high risk of financial loss. Do not use with real money without fully understanding the code and risks.

Features
Natural Language Trading: Use plain English in the Claude app to execute trades (e.g., "buy 10 shares of INFY at market price").

Real-time Data: Fetch and view your current trading positions.

Official SDK: Built with the mcp-sdk for robust and reliable communication with Claude.

Secure: Keeps your API keys and tokens local using a .env file.

Type-Safe: Uses Pydantic to ensure all data flowing between Claude and the trading API is correctly structured.

Setup and Installation
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

A Zerodha developer account (developers.kite.trade) with an API key.

The Claude Desktop Application.

2. Clone and Setup
# Clone the repository (or set up the files manually)
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd claude-python-trading-bot

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies from the updated requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure API Keys & Access Token
Create .env file: Create a file named .env in the root directory.

Add Credentials: Open the .env file and add your Zerodha API credentials:

KITE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
KITE_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"

Get Access Token: The access_token must be generated daily. I have provided a separate explanation on how to get this token using a manual login and a helper script. You must update the KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN in your .env file each day.

How to Run
Start the MCP Server:
Run the main.py script from your terminal. The official SDK will handle the connection.

python src/main.py

The server will start and print a message like Starting MCP server, waiting for Claude to connect....

Connect from Claude:

Open the Claude Desktop Application.

Go to the settings for using local tools.

Configure it to use the python src/main.py command as the local tool server.
